A Simple example of Text Recognizer using Firebase ML (Machine Learning)

# FireBase ML
ML Kit is a mobile SDK that brings Google's machine learning expertise to Android and iOS apps in a powerful yet easy-to-use package. Whether you're new or experienced in machine learning, you can easily implement the functionality you need in just a few lines of code. There's no need to have deep knowledge of neural networks or model optimization to get started.

# How does it work?
ML Kit makes it easy to apply ML techniques in your apps by bringing Google's ML technologies, such as the Google Cloud Vision API, Mobile Vision, and TensorFlow Lite, together in a single SDK. Whether you need the power of cloud-based processing, the real-time capabilities of Mobile Vision's on-device models, or the flexibility of custom TensorFlow Lite models, ML Kit makes it possible with just a few lines of code.

- Am using in this example the TextRecoginzer trained Model, to detect text from images.
